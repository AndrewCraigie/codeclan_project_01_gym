# Project - Web Programming with Ruby

The project is to be built using the following:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Constraints

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

### Gym

A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

#### MVP

- The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete members
- The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete classes
- The app should allow the gym to add members to specific classes
- The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
- The app should show all members that are registered for a particular class

#### Inspired By

[Glofox](https://www.glofox.com/club-solution/), [Pike13](https://www.pike13.com/pike13-scheduling-software-demo)

#### Possible Extensions

- Classes could have a maximum capacity, and users can only be added while there is space remaining.
- The gym could be able to give its members Premium or Standard membership. Standard members can only be signed up for classes during off-peak hours.

## Timescale and Deadline

The final project should be ready and pushed up to GitHub for **Wednesday at 12.**
